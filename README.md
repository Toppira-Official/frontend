## 🏗️ Technical Highlights

### ⚡ Build & Runtime

- **Vite 7** — Fast HMR, optimized production builds, native ESM
- **React 19** — Latest React APIs and improvements
- **TypeScript** — Strict mode, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` for maximum type safety
- **React Compiler (babel-plugin-react-compiler)** — Automatic memoization; fewer manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` optimizations
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first styling with `@tailwindcss/vite` integration

### 🧩 Architecture & Structure

- **Feature-based structure** — Separation by domain (`auth`, `home`, `common`) rather than by technical layer
- **Shared layouts** — `PublicLayout` (header + footer) and `DashboardLayout` (sidebar + content) for consistent UX
- **Route protection** — `RequireAuth` wrapper with `useLocation` for redirects while preserving intended destination
- **Typed configuration** — Header, footer, and FAQ data as typed TypeScript modules for type-safe content

### 🎨 Design & Accessibility

- **RTL support** — `direction="rtl"` on Ant Design ConfigProvider and sections; `dir="rtl"` on HTML root
- **Custom fonts** — Dana (primary) and Operator Mono (footer) with WOFF2 and `font-display: swap`
- **Responsive patterns** — Ant Design Grid (`Col`/`Row`) with breakpoints for mobile and desktop
- **Drawer navigation** — Collapsible header drawer on mobile with nested links

### 🔧 Code Quality

- **ESLint** — With React Hooks and React Refresh rules
- **Prettier** — With Tailwind class sorting
- **cspell** — Spell checking including Persian (fa-ir)
- **Strict TypeScript** — Strict and extra checks for safer refactoring

### 🚀 Production Readiness

- **PWA metadata** — Manifest, favicons, Apple touch icons, theme-color
- **Build pipeline** — TypeScript check (`tsc -b`) before Vite build for early error detection
- **Modular styling** — Tailwind layers (`@layer base`, `@layer components`) for maintainable CSS

## 📐 Conventions

- Keep features in their own folders (`features/auth`, `features/home`, etc.).
- Put shared layouts, components, types, and data in `shared/`.
- Use typed interfaces for data structures (e.g. `HeaderItem`, `FooterSection`).
- Use `RequireAuth` for any route that requires authentication.
- Prefer Ant Design components for consistency; extend with Tailwind when needed.
- Use `dir="rtl"` and Dana font for Persian content.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Full integration with backend auth (JWT, Google OAuth).
- Reminder and todo CRUD in the dashboard.
- API client layer and centralized error handling.
- **AI** integration for smart scheduling and categorization.
- Notification settings and reminder delivery UI.
